# Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation

This project implements a simplified version of the Raft consensus algorithm. The Raft algorithm is designed for managing a replicated log among a set of nodes to achieve consensus in a distributed system. This README provides an overview of the components and functionalities implemented in the system.

## Features

1. **Raft Node Operations:**
    
    - Election process for selecting a leader among nodes.
    - Heartbeat mechanism for maintaining leadership.
    - Handling append entries from the leader.
    - Handling request vote from a candidate.
2. **Ping Nodes:**
    
    - Regularly checks for inactive nodes.
    - Initiates a new election if a Raft member doesn't respond and is the leader.
3. **Client Interaction:**
    
    - Placeholder for handling client connections.
    - Logic for sending rewards and penalties to followers based on their behavior.
4. **Database Interaction:**
    
    - Stores rewards and intervals data in a MongoDB database.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- MongoDB
- Additional Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/kishansudani/super_node.git && cd super_node`
    
2. Install dependencies:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
3. Configure your MongoDB connection in `database/client.py`.
    
4. Run the Raft node:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `python super_node.py`
    

## Configuration

- Modify the configuration parameters in `super_node.py` to adjust Raft node behavior, such as election timeout, heartbeat interval, etc.

## Architecture

### RaftNode Class

- **`__init__(self, node_id)`**
    
    - Initializes a Raft node with a unique identifier.
- **`start_election(self)`**
    
    - Initiates a new election by sending request vote requests to all Raft members.
- **`send_request_vote_request(self, raft_member)`**
    
    - Sends a request for a vote to a Raft member.
- **`reset_election_timeout(self)`**
    
    - Resets the election timeout when starting a new election.
- **`become_leader(self)`**
    
    - Sets the node as the leader for the current term.
- **`reset_election(self)`**
    
    - Resets the election state when the node did not win the election.
- **`send_heartbeat(self)`**
    
    - Sends heartbeat messages to maintain leadership.
- **`handle_append_entries(self, leader_id, entries, leader_commit)`**
    
    - Handles append entries from the leader.
- **`handle_request_vote(self, term, candidate_id)`**
    
    - Handles a request for a vote from a candidate.
- **`handle_client(self, client_socket, addr)`**
    
    - Handles incoming client connections.
- **`ping_nodes(self)`**
    
    - Checks for inactive nodes and handles Raft consensus.
    - Initiates an election if a Raft member doesn't respond and is the leader.
- **`has_responded(self, member)`**
    
    - Checks if the Raft member has responded recently.
- **`is_raft_leader(self, member)`**
    
    - Checks if the Raft member is the leader.
- **`send_ping_request(self, member)`**
    
    - Sends a ping request to a Raft member.

### RaftNodeWorker Function

- **`raft_node_worker(raft_node)`**
    - Worker function for the Raft node thread.
    - Manages the election timeout and heartbeat mechanism.
