# ðŸš§ Under construction
## WARNING:

- I don't know what I'm building also but I'm trying to create something and trying to learn python also.

- What I've build so far?

- I've build cluster where there is:
    - One super Node
    - Validator Node
    - Follower Node

- `Ping`:
    - Follower node pings to the super node with `version|data|node_address`.
    - Super node will send ping message to follower node in array line by line at perticular interval if follower node does not send proper response to the super, super node will give penalty to the follower node.
    - Follower node must connect super node from specificed port only, if not super node will not connect to the follower node.

- `Reward`:
    - If Super node will receive the ping from follower node then supernode will list this address into dict and reward him.

- `Versioning`:
    - If version of follower node and supernode does not matches than supernode will disconnect the follower node.

- `Banning system`:
    - Super node pings follower node at perticular time interval, if it doesn't respond then it will increase ban count.
    - If ban count reaches the ban threshold for particular follower node, super node will disconnect the follower node.

- `Reward claiming api`:
    - Follower node can claim the reward
    - if follower node try to claim more reward than it currently has then it will penalize that follower node

- `List of API`:
    - `Super Node API`:
        - `get_follower_queue | Get list of followers` 
        - `node_info | get list of node with ip and port`
        - `get_rewards | get follower address and reward`


### To Do:
- [ ] Store everything into DB
- [X] Check ping response from follower node that it's his turn to ping the super node or not, if not increase ban count.
- [X] Banned node can only allowed to join the system again after particular time.
- [ ] Create proper reward system and use case for reward system.
- [ ] Add validator node structor
    - [ ] when user send data to the any node it forwards to the super node, super node will send data to validator node in sequnace.
    - [ ] User can not directly send data to the super node.
    - [ ] validator will sign the data and store it into the DB
    - [ ] Validator then send this signed data to the other validators and follower node
    - [ ] Other validator will verify this data and store it
    - [ ] Follower node will store the data
    - [ ] Create API for fetching stored data
    - [ ] Create api for sending data to follower node and validator node
    - [ ] Create Bootstrap node for new node(validator and follower)
- [ ] Use GRPC to communicate between two node
- [ ] Create Raft system for super node.
- [ ] Consistency Improvements
- [ ] Dynamic Cluster Membership
- [ ] Snapshotting and Log Compaction
- [ ] Concurrency Control
- [ ] Failure Detection and Recovery
- [ ] Secure Communication
- [ ] Extended Client API
- [ ] Performance Profiling and Optimization
- [ ] Monitoring and Metrics
- [ ] Automated Testing Framework
- [ ] Quorum-Based Operations
- [ ] Machine Learning for Performance Prediction
- [ ] Integration with Container Orchestration
- [ ] API Versioning and Compatibility
- [ ] In-Memory Mode for Small Clusters
- [ ] Documentation and Knowledge Base



### How to run
```javascript
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Generate new key if you don't have
    - open encryption.py file and rename `NODE_NAME` with your name for follower node.
```javascript
cd test
nano encryption.py
python encryption.py
```

- start supernode
```javascript
cd ..
python main.py
```

- open follower.py from follower folder
```javascript
nano follower/follower_node.py
```
- Find `node_name` varibale and change it's value which you have set in `NODE_NAME`.

- start follower node
```javascript
python follower/follower_node.py
```
